Gutenberg sample block


## Description

It is a plug-in version of the block I created by studying custom blocks in Gutenberg.

## Usage
There is nothing convenient to use, but I hope it will be useful for custom block development. I made a block that uses the current image as a headline and a brown medium heading at https://z-tree.jp/.

## Install

Put [block-custom] in the WordPress "plugins" folder and activate it on the management screen. “Brown medium headline” and “Large headline image” blocks can be created.

### Update

* 11/12 update: css is read externally. When I try to edit a currently saved block, I get the error "This block contains unexpected or invalid content". Currently under investigation.

* 11/13 update:
The error has been corrected. Also, because the block name is long, it was modified to “title-brown”.
